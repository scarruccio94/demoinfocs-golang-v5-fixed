# Capturing Voice Data

## CS2

See https://github.com/DandrewsDev/CS2VoiceData

## CS:GO

This example shows how to use the library to capture voice audio from demos.

Since the build process is somewhat different from the library itself (due to usage of CGO), the example has it's own repository which you can find here:
